sit down awhile and let us once again assail your ears that are so fortified against our story what we two nights have seen well sit we down and let us hear barnardo speak of this last night of all when yond same star that s westward from the pole had made his course t illume that part of heaven where now it burns marcellus and myself the bell then beating one peace break thee off look where it comes again enter ghost in the same figure like the king that s dead thou art a scholar speak to it horatio looks it not like the king mark it horatio most like it harrows me with fear and wonder barnardo it would be spoke to question it horatio what art thou that usurp st this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak it is offended see it stalks away stay speak speak i charge thee speak exit ghost tis gone and will not answer how now horatio you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you on t before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes is it not like the king as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he th ambitious norway combated so frown d he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appear d to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride dar d to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem d him did slay this fortinbras who by a seal d compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seiz d of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had return d to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same cov nant and carriage of the article design d his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark d up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen re enter ghost but soft behold lo where it comes again i ll cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak the cock crows stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan do if it will not stand tis here tis here exit ghost tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt scene elsinore a room of state in the castle enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barr d your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltemand and cornelius and now laertes what s the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father s leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal d my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool d for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforc d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king s rouse the heaven shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away exeunt all but hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fix d his canon gainst self slaughter o god o god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie on t oh fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father s body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn d longer married with mine uncle my father s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and barnardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend i ll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord i am very glad to see you good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg a truant disposition good my lord i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore we ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart my lord i came to see your father s funeral i prithee do not mock me fellow student i think it was to see my mother s wedding indeed my lord it follow d hard upon thrift thrift horatio the funeral bak d meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio my father methinks i see my father where my lord in my mind s eye horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for god s love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encounter d a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap a pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk d by their oppress d and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon s length whilst they distill d almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish d from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honour d lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight mar and we do my lord arm d say you both arm d my lord from top to toe my lord from head to foot then saw you not his face o yes my lord he wore his beaver up what look d he frowningly a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red nay very pale and fix d his eyes upon you most constantly i would i had been there it would have much amaz d you very like very like stay d it long while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred marcellus and longer longer not when i saw t his beard was grizzled no it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver d i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again i warrant you it will if it assume my noble father s person i ll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceal d this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare ye well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve i ll visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell exeunt horatio marcellus and barnardo my father s spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes exit scene a room in polonius s house enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries are embark d farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh d his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalu d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscrib d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster d importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclos d and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near i shall th effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whilst like a puff d and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay d for there my blessing with you laying his hand on laertes s head and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportion d thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatch d unfledg d comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear t that th opposed may beware of thee give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each man s censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express d in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee most humbly do i take my leave my lord the time invites you go your servants tend farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you tis in my memory lock d and you yourself shall keep the key of it farewell exit what is t ophelia he hath said to you so please you something touching the lord hamlet marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me affection pooh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them i do not know my lord what i should think marry i ll teach you think yourself a baby that you have ta en these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase roaming it thus you ll tender me a fool my lord he hath importun d me with love in honourable fashion ay fashion you may call it go to go to and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to t i charge you come your ways i shall obey my lord exeunt scene the platform enter hamlet horatio and marcellus the air bites shrewdly it is very cold it is a nipping and an eager air what hour now i think it lacks of twelve no it is struck indeed i heard it not it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within what does this mean my lord the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge is it a custom ay marry is t and to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honour d in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduc d and tax d of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though perform d at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by their o ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature s livery or fortune s star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of evil doth all the noble substance often doubt to his own scandal look my lord it comes enter ghost angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn d bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou com st in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee i ll call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canoniz d bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurn d hath op d his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisit st thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do ghost beckons hamlet it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it no by no means it will not speak then will i follow it do not my lord why what should be the fear i do not set my life at a pin s fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself it waves me forth again i ll follow it what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o er his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fadoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath it waves me still go on i ll follow thee you shall not go my lord hold off your hands be rul d you shall not go my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lion s nerve ghost beckons still am i call d unhand me gentlemen breaking free from them by heaven i ll make a ghost of him that lets me i say away go on i ll follow thee exeunt ghost and hamlet he waxes desperate with imagination let s follow tis not fit thus to obey him have after to what issue will this come something is rotten in the state of denmark heaven will direct it nay let s follow him exeunt scene v a more remote part of the castle enter ghost and hamlet whither wilt thou lead me speak i ll go no further mark me i will my hour is almost come when i to sulph rous and tormenting flames must render up myself alas poor ghost pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold speak i am bound to hear so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear what i am thy father s spirit doom d for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confin d to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purg d away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood list list o list if thou didst ever thy dear father love o god revenge his foul and most unnatural murder murder murder most foul as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural haste me to know t that i with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge i find thee apt and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf wouldst thou not stir in this

sting thy father s life now wears his crown o my prophetic soul mine uncle ay that incestuous that adulterate beast with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts o wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seduce won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming virtuous queen o hamlet what a falling off was there from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine but virtue as it never will be mov d though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven so lust though to a radiant angel link d will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage but soft methinks i scent the morning air brief let me be sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigour it doth posset and curd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter bark d about most lazar like with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body thus was i sleeping by a brother s hand of life of crown of queen at once dispatch d cut off even in the blossoms of my sin unhous led disappointed unanel d no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head o horrible o horrible most horrible if thou hast nature in thee bear it not let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest but howsoever thou pursu st this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her fare thee well at once the glow worm shows the matin to be near and gins to pale his uneffectual

please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty as gaming my lord ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far my lord that would dishonour him faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that s not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault but my good lord wherefore should you do this ay my lord i would know that marry sir here s my drift and i believe it is a fetch of warrant you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soil d i th working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assur d he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country very good my lord and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes with you thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such and such and as you say there was he gaming there o ertook in s rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not my lord i have god b wi you fare you well good my lord observe his inclination in yourself i shall my lord and let him ply his music well my lord farewell exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now ophelia what s the matter alas my lord i have been so affrighted with what in the name of god my lord as i was sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac d no hat upon his head his stockings foul d ungart red and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay d he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet s transformation so i call it since nor th exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father s death that thus hath put him so much from th understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbour d to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open d lies within our remedy good gentlemen he hath much talk d of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king s remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is heavens make our

be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in exit polonius he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your son s distemper i doubt it is no other but the main his father s death and our o erhasty marriage well we shall sift him enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew s levies which to him appear d to be a preparation gainst the polack but better look d into he truly found it was against your highness whereat griev d that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown gives a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down it likes us well and at our more consider d time we ll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labour go to your rest at night we ll feast together most welcome home exeunt voltemand and cornelius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day

son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have whilst she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise reads to the celestial and my soul s idol the most beautified ophelia that s an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear reads these in her

him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter show d me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she receiv d his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceiv d it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look d upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time i d fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it prov d otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise points to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i ll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will try it enter hamlet reading but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading away i do beseech you both away i ll board him presently o give me leave exeunt king queen and attendants how does my good lord hamlet well god a mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you re a fishmonger not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that s very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter i have my lord let her not walk i th sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t how say you by that aside still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i ll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside though this be madness yet there is a method in t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not over happy on fortune s cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what s the news none my lord but that the world s grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark s a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch d heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz and we ll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no to guildenstern what say you aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is t possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius well be with you gentlemen hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts happily he s the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir for a monday morning twas so indeed my lord i have news to tell you my lord i have news to tell

en to t like french falconers fly at anything we see we ll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first what speech my lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg d for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her

that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look where he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god s bodikin man better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we ll hear a play tomorrow exeunt polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago first ay my lord we ll ha t tomorrow night you could for a need study a

in s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had

ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i ll observe his looks i ll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power t assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i ll have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king exit act iii scene i a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we o er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseech d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin d good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behav d if t be th affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much prov d that with devotion s visage and pious action we do sugar o er the devil himself aside o tis too true how smart a

coming let s withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wish d to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor s wrong the proud man s contumely the pangs of dispriz d love the law s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember d good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly thank you well well well my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re deliver i pray you now receive them no not i i never gave you aught my honour d lord you know right well you

ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not

scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this

by fortinbras of norway thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride dar d to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem d him did slay this fortinbras who by a seal d compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seiz d of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had return d to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same cov nant and carriage of the article design d his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark d up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to

day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him

colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty

is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father s leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal d my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool d for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforc d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king s rouse the heaven shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away exeunt all but hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fix d his canon gainst self slaughter o god o god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie on t oh fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father s body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn d longer married with mine uncle my father s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and barnardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend i ll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord i am very glad to see you good even sir but what

upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for god s love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encounter d a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap a pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk d by their oppress d and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon s length whilst they distill d almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish d from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honour d lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight mar and we do my lord arm d say you both arm d my lord from top to toe my lord from head to foot then saw you not his face o yes my lord he wore his beaver up what look d he frowningly a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red nay very pale and fix d his eyes upon you most constantly i would i had been there it would have much amaz d you very like very like stay d it long while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred marcellus and longer longer not when i saw t his beard was grizzled no it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver d i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again i warrant you it will if it assume my noble father s person i ll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceal d this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare ye well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve i ll visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell exeunt horatio marcellus and barnardo my father s spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes exit scene a room in polonius s house enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries are embark d farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh d his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalu d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscrib d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster d importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclos d and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near i shall th effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whilst like a puff d and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay d for there my blessing with you laying his hand on laertes s head and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportion d thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatch d unfledg d comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear t that th opposed may beware of thee give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each man s censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express d in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee most humbly do i take my leave my lord the time invites you go your servants tend farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you tis in my memory lock d and you yourself shall keep the key of it farewell exit what is t ophelia he hath said to you so please you something touching the lord hamlet marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me affection pooh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them i do not know my lord what i should think marry i ll teach you think yourself a baby that you have ta en these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase roaming it thus you ll tender me a fool my lord he hath importun d me with love in honourable fashion ay fashion you may call it go to go to and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to t i charge you come your ways i shall obey my lord exeunt scene the platform enter hamlet horatio and marcellus the air bites shrewdly it is very cold it is a nipping and an eager air what hour now i think it lacks of twelve no it is struck indeed i heard it not it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within what does this mean my lord the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge is it a custom ay marry is t and to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honour d in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduc d and tax d of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though perform d at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by their o ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature s livery or fortune s star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of evil doth all the noble substance often doubt to his own scandal look my lord it comes enter ghost angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn d bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou com st in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee i ll call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canoniz d bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurn d hath op d his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisit st thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do ghost beckons hamlet it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it no by no means it will not speak then will i follow it do not my lord why what should be the fear i do not set my life at a pin s fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself it waves me forth again i ll follow it what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o er his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fadoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath it waves me still go on i ll follow thee you shall not go my lord hold off your hands be rul d you shall not go my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lion s nerve ghost beckons still am i call d unhand me gentlemen breaking free from them by heaven i ll make a ghost of him that lets me i say away go on i

when thou shalt hear what i am thy father s spirit doom d for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confin d to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purg d away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood

noble youth the serpent that did sting thy father s life now wears his crown o my prophetic soul mine uncle ay that incestuous that adulterate beast with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts o wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seduce won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming virtuous queen o hamlet what a falling off was there from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine but virtue as it never will be mov d though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven so lust though to a radiant angel link d will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage but soft methinks i scent the morning air brief let me be sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigour it doth posset and curd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter bark d about most lazar like with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body thus was i sleeping by a brother s hand of life of crown of queen at once dispatch d cut off even in the blossoms of my sin unhous led disappointed unanel d no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head o horrible o horrible most horrible if thou hast nature in thee bear it not let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest but howsoever thou pursu st this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her fare thee well at once the glow worm shows the matin to be near and gins to pale his uneffectual fire adieu adieu adieu hamlet remember me exit o all you host of heaven o earth what else and shall i couple hell o fie hold my heart and you my sinews grow not instant

house enter polonius and reynaldo give him this money and these notes reynaldo i will my lord you shall do marvellous wisely good reynaldo before you visit him to make inquiry of his behaviour my lord i did intend it marry well said very well said look you sir enquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him do you mark this reynaldo ay very well my lord and in part him but you may say not well but if t be he i mean he s very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty as gaming my lord ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far my lord that would dishonour him faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that s not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault but my good lord wherefore should you do this ay my lord i would know that marry sir here s my drift and i believe it is a fetch of warrant you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soil d i th working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assur d he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country very good my lord and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes with you thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such and such and as you say there was he gaming there o ertook in s rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not my lord i have god b wi you fare you well good my lord observe his inclination in yourself i shall my lord and let him ply his music well my lord farewell exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now ophelia what s the matter alas my lord i have been so affrighted with what in the name of god my lord as i was sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac d no hat upon his head his stockings foul d ungart red and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay d he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet s transformation so i call it since nor th exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father s death that thus hath put him so much from th understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbour d to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open d lies within our remedy good gentlemen he hath much talk d of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king s remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is heavens make our

be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in exit polonius he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your son s distemper i doubt it is no other but the main his father s death and our o erhasty marriage well we shall sift him enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew s levies which to him appear d to be a preparation gainst the polack but better look d into he truly found it was against your highness whereat griev d that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown gives a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down it likes us well and at our more consider d time we ll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labour go to your rest at night we ll feast together most welcome home exeunt voltemand and cornelius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have whilst she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this

you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceiv d it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look d upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time i d fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it prov d otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise points to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i ll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will try it enter hamlet reading but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading away i do beseech you both away i ll board him presently o give me leave exeunt king queen and attendants how does my good lord hamlet well god a mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you re a fishmonger not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that s very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter i have my lord let her not walk i th sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t how say you by that aside still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i ll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside though this be madness yet there is a method in t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not over happy on fortune s cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what s the news none my lord but that the world s grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark s a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch d heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz and we ll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no to guildenstern what say you aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is t possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius well be with you gentlemen hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts happily he s the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir for a monday morning twas so indeed my lord i have news to tell you my lord i have news to tell you when roscius was an actor in rome the actors are come hither my lord buzz buzz upon my honour then came each actor on his ass the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history

en to t like french falconers fly at anything we see we ll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first what speech my lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg d for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her

s state would treason have pronounc d but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband s limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look where he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god s bodikin man better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we ll hear a play tomorrow exeunt polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago first ay my lord we ll ha t tomorrow night you could for a need study a

guildenstern my good friends i ll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore good my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern ay so god b wi ye now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wan d tears in his eyes distraction in s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most

revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a scullion fie upon t foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim d their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i ll observe his looks i ll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power t assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i ll have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king exit act iii scene i a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we o er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseech d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin d good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behav d if t be th affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much prov d that with devotion s visage and pious action we do sugar o er the devil himself aside o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot s cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden i hear him coming let s withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wish d to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor s wrong the proud man s contumely the pangs of dispriz d love the law s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember d good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly thank you well well well my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re deliver i pray you now receive them no not i i never gave you aught my honour d lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath compos d as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord ha ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where s your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in s own house farewell o help him you sweet heavens if thou dost marry i ll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell o heavenly powers restore

that unmatch d form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me t have seen what i have seen see what i see enter king and polonius love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lack d form a little was not like madness there s something in his soul o er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i ll be plac d so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatch d go exeunt scene a hall in the castle enter hamlet and certain players speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it first i warrant your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably first i hope we have reform d that indifferently with us sir o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that s villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready exeunt players enter polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern

whose epitaph is for o for o the hobby horse is forgot trumpets sound the dumb show enters enter a king and a queen very lovingly the queen embracing him and he her she kneels and makes show of protestation unto him he takes her up and declines his head upon her neck lays him down upon a bank of flowers she seeing him asleep leaves him anon comes in a fellow takes off his crown kisses it pours poison in the king s ears and exits the queen returns finds the king dead and makes passionate action the poisoner with some three or four mutes comes in again seeming to lament with her the dead body is carried away the poisoner woos the queen with gifts she seems loth and unwilling awhile but in the end accepts his love exeunt what means this my lord marry this is miching mallicho it means mischief belike this show imports the argument of the play enter prologue we shall know by this fellow the players cannot keep counsel they ll tell all will they tell us what this show meant ay or any show that you ll show him be not you ashamed to show he ll not shame to tell you what it means you are naught you are naught i ll mark the play for us and for our tragedy here stooping to your clemency we beg your hearing patiently is this a prologue or the posy of a ring tis brief my lord as woman s love enter a king and a queen player full thirty times hath phoebus cart gone round neptune s salt wash and tellus orbed ground and thirty dozen moons with borrow d sheen about the world have times twelve thirties been since love our hearts and hymen did our hands unite commutual in most sacred bands player so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count o er ere love be done but woe is me you are so sick of late so far from cheer and from your former state that i distrust you yet though i distrust discomfort you my lord it nothing must for women s fear and love holds quantity in neither aught or in extremity now what my love is proof hath made you know and as my love is siz d my fear is so where love is great the littlest doubts are fear where little fears grow great great love grows there player faith i must leave thee love and shortly too my operant powers their functions leave to do and thou shalt live in this fair world behind honour d belov d and haply one as kind for husband shalt thou player o confound the rest such love must needs be treason in my breast in second husband let me be accurst none wed the second but who kill d the first aside wormwood wormwood player the instances that second marriage move are base respects of thrift but none of love a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed player i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break purpose is but the slave to memory of violent birth but poor validity which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending doth the purpose lose the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy where joy most revels grief doth most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident this world is not for aye nor tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change for tis a question left us yet to prove whether love lead fortune or else fortune love the great man down you mark his favourite flies the poor advanc d makes friends of enemies and hitherto doth love on fortune tend for who not needs shall never lack a friend and who in want a hollow friend doth try directly seasons him his enemy but orderly to end where i begun our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown our

sledded polacks on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appear d to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride dar d to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem d him did slay this fortinbras who by a seal d compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seiz d of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had return d to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same cov nant and carriage of the article design d his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark d up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to

thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak the cock crows stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan do if it will not stand tis here tis here exit ghost tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt scene elsinore a room of state in the castle enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barr d your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltemand and cornelius and now laertes what s the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father s leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal d my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool d for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforc d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king s rouse the heaven shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away exeunt all but hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fix d his canon gainst self slaughter o god o god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world

that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father s body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn d longer married with mine uncle my father s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and barnardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend i ll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord i am very glad to see you good even sir but what

upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for god s love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encounter d a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap a pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk d by their oppress d and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon s length whilst they distill d almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish d from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honour d lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight mar and we do my lord arm d say you both arm d my lord from top to toe my lord from head

beard was grizzled no it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver d i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again i warrant you it will if it assume my noble father s person i ll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceal d this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare ye well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve i ll visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell exeunt

house enter polonius and reynaldo give him this money and these notes reynaldo i will my lord you shall do marvellous wisely good reynaldo before you visit him to make inquiry of his behaviour my lord i did intend it marry well said very well said look you sir enquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him do you mark this reynaldo ay very well my lord and in part him but you may say not well but if t be he i mean he s very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty as gaming my lord ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far my lord that would dishonour him faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that s not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault but my good lord wherefore should you do this ay my lord i would know that marry sir here s my drift and i believe it is a fetch of warrant you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soil d i th working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assur d he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country very good my lord and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes with you thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such and such and as you say there was he gaming there o ertook in s rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not my lord i have god b wi you fare you well good my lord observe his inclination in yourself i shall my lord and let him ply his music well my lord farewell exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now ophelia what s the matter alas my lord i have been so affrighted with what in the name of god my lord as i was sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac d no hat upon his head his stockings foul d ungart red and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay d he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet s transformation so i call it since nor th exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father s death that thus hath put him so much from th understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbour d to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open d lies within our remedy good gentlemen he hath much talk d of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king s remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him ay amen exeunt rosencrantz guildenstern and some attendants enter polonius th ambassadors from norway my good lord are joyfully return d thou still hast been the father of good news have i my lord assure you my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath us d to do that i have found the very cause of hamlet s lunacy o speak of that that do i long to hear give first admittance to th ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in exit polonius he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your son s distemper i doubt it is no other but the main his father s death and our o erhasty marriage well we shall sift him enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew s levies which to him appear d to be a preparation gainst the polack but better look d into he truly found it was against your highness whereat griev d that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown gives a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down it likes us well and at our more consider d time we ll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labour go to your rest at night we ll feast together most welcome home exeunt voltemand and cornelius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have whilst she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise reads to the celestial and my soul s idol the most beautified ophelia that s an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear reads these in her excellent white bosom these c came this from hamlet to her good madam stay awhile i will be faithful reads doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers i have not art to reckon my groans but that i love thee best o most best believe it adieu thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter show d me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she receiv d his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceiv d it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look d upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time i d fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it prov d otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise points to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i ll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will try it enter hamlet reading but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading away i do beseech you both away i ll board him presently o give me leave exeunt king queen and attendants how does my good lord hamlet well god a mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you re a fishmonger not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that s very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter i have my lord let her not walk i th sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t how say you by that aside still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i ll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside though this be madness yet there is a method in t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not over happy on fortune s cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what s the news none my lord but that the world s grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark s a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch d heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz and we ll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no to guildenstern what say you aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is t possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than

en to t like french falconers fly at anything we see we ll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first what speech my lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg d for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends this is too long it shall to the barber s with your beard prythee say on he s for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps say on come to hecuba first but who o who had seen the mobled queen the mobled queen that s good mobled queen is good first run barefoot up and down threat ning the flames with bisson rheum a clout upon that head where late the diadem stood and for a robe about her lank and all o erteemed loins a blanket in th alarm of fear caught up who this had seen with tongue in venom steep d gainst fortune s state would treason have pronounc d but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband s limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look where he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god s bodikin man better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we ll hear a play tomorrow exeunt polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago first ay my lord we ll ha t tomorrow night you could for a need study a

guildenstern my good friends i ll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore good my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern ay so god b wi ye now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wan d tears in his eyes distraction in s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damn d defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i th throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon liver d and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this slave s offal bloody bawdy villain remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain oh vengeance why what an ass am i this is most brave that i the son of a dear father murder d prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a scullion fie upon t foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim d their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i ll observe his looks i ll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power t assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i ll have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king exit act iii scene i a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we o er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseech d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin d good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behav d if t be th affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much prov d that with devotion s visage and pious action we do sugar o er the devil himself aside o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot s cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden i hear him coming let s withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wish d to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor s wrong the proud man s contumely the pangs of dispriz d love the law s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember d good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly thank you well well well my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re deliver i pray you now receive them no not i i never gave you aught my honour d lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath compos d as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord ha ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where s your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in s own house farewell o help him you sweet heavens if thou dost marry i ll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell o heavenly powers restore

that unmatch d form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me t have seen what i have seen see what i see enter king and polonius love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lack d form a little was not like madness there s something in his soul o er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i ll be plac d so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatch d go exeunt scene a hall in the castle enter hamlet and certain players speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it first i warrant your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably first i hope we have reform d that indifferently with us sir o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that s villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready exeunt players enter polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern

you yet though i distrust discomfort you my lord it nothing must for women s fear and love holds quantity in neither aught or in extremity now what my love is proof hath made you know and as my love is siz d my fear is so where love is great the littlest doubts are fear where little fears grow great great love grows there player faith i must leave thee love and shortly too my operant powers their

breast in second husband let me be accurst none wed the second but who kill d the first aside wormwood wormwood player the instances that second marriage move are base respects of thrift but none of love a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed player i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break purpose is but the slave to memory of violent birth but poor validity which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending doth the purpose lose the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy where joy most revels grief doth most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident this world is not for aye nor tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change for tis a question left us yet to prove whether love lead fortune or else fortune love the great man down you mark his favourite flies the poor advanc d makes friends of enemies and hitherto doth love on fortune tend for who not needs shall never lack a friend and who in want a hollow friend doth try directly seasons him his enemy but orderly to end where i begun our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown our

no sequel at the heels of this mother s admiration she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed we shall obey were she ten times our mother have you any further trade with us my lord you once did love me and so i do still by these pickers and stealers good my lord what is your cause of distemper you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend sir i lack advancement how can that be when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in denmark ay sir but while the grass grows the proverb is something musty re enter the players with recorders o the recorders let me see one to withdraw with you why do you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me into a toil o my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerly i do not well understand that will you play upon this pipe my lord i cannot i pray you believe me i cannot i do beseech you i know no touch of it my lord tis as easy as lying govern these ventages with your finger and thumb give it breath with your mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music look you these are the stops but these cannot i command to any utterance of harmony i have not the skill why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me you would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it speak sblood do you think i am easier to be played on than a pipe call me what instrument you will though you can fret me you cannot play upon me enter polonius god bless you sir my lord the queen would speak with you and presently do you see yonder cloud that s almost in shape of a camel by the mass and tis like a camel indeed methinks it is like a weasel it is backed like a weasel or like a whale very like a whale then will i come to my mother by and by they fool me to the top of my bent i will come by and by i will say so exit by and by is easily said leave me friends exeunt all but hamlet tis now the very witching time of night when churchyards yawn and hell itself

with brother s blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offence and what s in prayer but this twofold force to be forestalled ere we come to fall or pardon d being down then i ll look up my fault is past but o what form of prayer can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since i am still possess

sledded polacks on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appear d to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride dar d to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem d him did slay this fortinbras who by a seal d compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seiz d of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had return d to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same cov nant and carriage of the article design d his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark d up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen re enter ghost but soft behold lo where it comes again i ll cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak the cock crows stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan do if it will not stand tis here tis here exit ghost tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt scene elsinore a room of state in the castle enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barr d your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltemand and cornelius and now laertes what s the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father s leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal d my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool d for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforc d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king s rouse the heaven shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away exeunt all but hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fix d his canon gainst self slaughter o god o god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie on t oh fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father s body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn d longer married with mine uncle my father s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and barnardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend i ll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord i am very glad to see you good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg a truant disposition good my lord i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore we ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart my lord i came to see your father s funeral i prithee do not mock me fellow student i think it was to see my mother s wedding indeed my lord it follow d hard upon thrift thrift horatio the funeral bak d meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio my father methinks i see my father where my lord in my mind s eye horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for god s love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encounter d a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap a pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk d by their oppress d and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon s length whilst they distill d almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish d from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honour d lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight mar and we do my lord arm d say you both arm d my lord from top to toe my lord from head to foot then saw you not his face o yes my lord he wore his beaver up what look d he frowningly a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red nay very pale and fix d his eyes upon you most constantly i would i had been there it would have much amaz d you very like very like stay d it long while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred marcellus and longer longer not when i saw t his beard was grizzled no it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver d i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again i warrant you it will if it assume my noble father s person i ll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceal d this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare ye well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve i ll visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell exeunt horatio marcellus and barnardo my father s spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes exit scene a room in polonius s house enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries are embark d farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh d his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalu d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscrib d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster d importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclos d and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near i shall th effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whilst like a puff d and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay d for there my blessing with you laying his hand on laertes s head and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportion d thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatch d unfledg d comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear t that th opposed may beware of thee give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each man s censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express d in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee most humbly do i take my leave my lord the time invites you go your servants tend farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you tis in my memory lock d and you yourself shall keep the key of it farewell exit what is t ophelia he hath said to you so please you something touching the lord hamlet marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me affection pooh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them i do not know my lord what i should think marry i ll teach you think yourself a baby that you have ta en these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase roaming it thus you ll tender me a fool my lord he hath importun d me with love in honourable fashion ay fashion you may call it go to go to and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to t i charge you come your ways i shall obey my lord exeunt scene the platform enter hamlet horatio and marcellus the air bites shrewdly it is very cold it is a nipping and an eager air what hour now i think it lacks of twelve no it is struck indeed i heard it not it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within what does this mean my lord the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge is it a custom ay marry is t and to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honour d in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduc d and tax d of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though perform d at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by their o ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature s livery or fortune s star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of evil doth all the noble substance often doubt to his own scandal look my lord it comes enter ghost

questionable shape that i will speak to thee i ll call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canoniz d bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurn d hath op d his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisit st thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do ghost beckons hamlet it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it no by no means it will not speak then will i follow it do not my lord why what should be the fear i do not set my life at a pin s fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself it waves me forth again i ll follow it what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o er his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fadoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath it waves me still go on i ll follow thee you shall not go my lord hold off your hands be rul d you shall not go my fate cries out and makes each petty

i did intend it marry well said very well said look you sir enquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him do you mark this reynaldo ay very well my lord and in part him but you may say not well but if t be he i mean he s very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty as gaming my lord ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far my lord that would dishonour him faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that s not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault but my good lord wherefore should you do this ay my lord i would know that marry sir here s my drift and i believe it is a fetch of warrant you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soil d i th working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assur d he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country very good my lord and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes with you thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such and such and as you say there was he gaming there o ertook in s rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not my lord i have god b wi you fare you well good my lord observe his inclination in yourself i shall my lord and let him ply his music well my lord farewell exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now ophelia what s the matter alas my lord i have been so affrighted with what in the name of god my lord as i was sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac d no hat upon his head his stockings foul d ungart red and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay d he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet s transformation so i call it since nor th exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father s death that thus hath put him so much from th understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbour d to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open d lies within our remedy good gentlemen he hath much talk d of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king s remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is heavens make our

be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in exit polonius he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your son s distemper i doubt it is no other but the main his father s death and our o erhasty marriage well we shall sift him enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew s levies which to him appear d to be a preparation gainst the polack but better look d into he truly found it was against your highness whereat griev d that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown gives a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down it likes us well and at our more consider d time we ll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labour go to your rest at night we ll feast together most welcome home exeunt voltemand and cornelius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day

son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have whilst she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this

him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter show d me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she receiv d his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceiv d it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look d upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time i d fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it prov d otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise points to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i ll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will try it enter hamlet reading but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading away i do beseech you both away i ll board him presently o give me leave exeunt king queen and attendants how does my good lord hamlet well god a mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you re a fishmonger not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that s very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter i have my lord let her not walk i th sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t how say you by that aside still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i ll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside though this be madness yet there is a method in t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not over happy on fortune s cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what s the news none my lord but that the world s grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark s a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch d heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz and we ll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no to guildenstern what say you aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is t possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius well be with you gentlemen hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts happily he s the second time come to them for they say an

en to t like french falconers fly at anything we see we ll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first what speech my lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg d for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her

s state would treason have pronounc d but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband s limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look where he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god s bodikin man better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we ll hear a play tomorrow exeunt polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago first ay my lord we ll ha t tomorrow night you could for a need study a

in s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had

from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we o er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseech d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin d good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behav d if t be th affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much prov d that with devotion s visage and pious action we do sugar o er the devil himself aside o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot s cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden i hear him coming let s withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wish d to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor s wrong the proud man s contumely the pangs of dispriz d love the law s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember d good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly

ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where s your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool

that unmatch d form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me t have seen what i have seen see what i see enter king and polonius love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lack d form a little was not like madness there s something in his soul o er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i ll be plac d so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatch d go exeunt scene a hall in the castle enter hamlet and certain players speak the speech i pray you as i

gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it first i warrant your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably first i hope we have reform d that indifferently with us sir o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary

looks it not like the king mark it horatio most like it harrows me with fear and wonder barnardo it would be spoke to question it horatio what art thou that usurp st this time of night together with that fair and warlike form in which the majesty of buried denmark did sometimes march by heaven i charge thee speak it is offended see it stalks away stay speak speak i charge thee speak exit ghost tis gone and will not answer how now horatio you tremble and look pale is not this something more than fantasy what think you on t before my god i might not this believe without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes is it not like the king as thou art to thyself such was the very armour he had on when he th ambitious norway combated so frown d he once when in an angry parle he smote the sledded polacks on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appear d to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride dar d to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem d him did slay this fortinbras who by a seal d compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seiz d of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had return d to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same cov nant and carriage of the article design d his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark d up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen re enter ghost but soft behold lo where it comes again i ll cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak the cock crows stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan do if it will not stand tis here tis here exit ghost tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt scene elsinore a room of state in the castle enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barr d your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltemand and cornelius and now laertes what s the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father s leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal d my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool d for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforc d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king s rouse the heaven shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away exeunt all but hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fix d his canon gainst self slaughter o god o god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie on t oh fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father s body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn d longer married with mine uncle my father s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and barnardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend i ll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord i am very glad to see you good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg a truant disposition good my lord i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore we ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart my lord i came to see your father s funeral i prithee do not mock me fellow student i think it was to see my mother s wedding indeed my lord it follow d hard upon thrift thrift horatio the funeral bak d meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio my father methinks i see my father where my lord in my mind s eye horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for god s love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encounter d a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap a pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk d by their oppress d and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon s length whilst they distill d almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish d from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honour d lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight mar and we do my lord arm d say you both arm d my lord from top to toe my lord from head to foot then saw you not his face o yes my lord he wore his beaver up what look d he frowningly a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red nay very pale and fix d his eyes upon you most constantly i would i had been there it would have much amaz d you very like very like stay d it long while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred marcellus and longer longer not when i saw t his beard was grizzled no it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver d i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again i warrant you it will if it assume my noble father s person i ll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceal d this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare ye well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve i ll visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell exeunt horatio marcellus and barnardo my father s spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes exit scene a room in polonius s house enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries are embark d farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh d his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalu d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscrib d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster d importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclos d and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near i shall th effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whilst like a puff d and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay d for there my blessing with you laying his hand on laertes s head and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportion d thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatch d unfledg d comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear t that th opposed may beware of thee give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each man s censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express d in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee most humbly do i take my leave my lord the time invites you go your servants tend farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you tis in my memory lock d and you yourself shall keep the key of it farewell exit what is t ophelia he hath said to you so please you something touching the lord hamlet marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me affection pooh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them i do not know my lord what i should think marry i ll teach you think yourself a baby that you have ta en these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase roaming it thus you ll tender me a fool my lord he hath importun d me with love in honourable fashion ay fashion you may call it go to go to and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to t i charge you come your ways i shall obey my lord exeunt scene the platform enter hamlet horatio and marcellus the air bites shrewdly it is very cold it is a nipping and an eager air what hour now i think it lacks of twelve no it is struck indeed i heard it not it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within what does this mean my lord the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge is it a custom ay marry is t and to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honour d in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduc d and tax d of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though perform d at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by their o ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature s livery or fortune s star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of evil doth all the noble substance often doubt to his own scandal look my lord it comes enter ghost angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn d bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou com st in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee i ll call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canoniz d bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurn d hath op d his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisit st thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do ghost beckons hamlet it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it no by no means it will not speak then will i follow it do not my lord why what should be the fear i do not set my life at a pin s fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself it waves me forth again i ll follow it what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o er his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fadoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath it waves me still go on i ll follow thee you shall not go my lord hold off your hands be rul d you shall not go my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lion s nerve ghost beckons still am i call d unhand me gentlemen breaking free from them by heaven i ll make a ghost of him that lets me i say away go on i

heaven will direct it nay let s follow him exeunt scene v a more remote part of the castle enter ghost and hamlet whither wilt thou lead me speak i ll go no further mark me i will my hour is almost come when i to sulph rous and tormenting flames must render up myself alas poor ghost pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold speak i am bound to hear so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear what i am thy father s spirit doom d for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confin d to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purg d away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood list list o list if thou didst ever thy dear father love o god revenge his foul and most unnatural murder murder murder most foul as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural haste me to know t that i with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge i find thee apt and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear tis given out that sleeping in my orchard a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abus d but know thou noble youth the serpent that did sting thy father s life now wears his crown o my prophetic soul mine uncle ay that incestuous that adulterate beast with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts o wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seduce won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming virtuous queen o hamlet what a falling off was there from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine but virtue as it never will be mov d though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven so lust though to a radiant angel link d will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage but soft methinks i scent the morning air brief let me be sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigour it doth posset and curd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter bark d about most lazar like with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body thus was i sleeping by a brother s hand of life of crown of queen at once dispatch d cut off even in the blossoms of my sin unhous led disappointed unanel d no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head o horrible o horrible most horrible if thou hast nature in thee bear it not let not the royal bed of denmark be a couch for luxury and damned incest but howsoever thou pursu st this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her fare thee well at once the glow worm shows the matin to be near and gins to pale his uneffectual fire adieu adieu adieu hamlet remember me exit o all you host of heaven o earth what else and shall i couple hell o fie hold my heart and you my sinews grow not instant

sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac d no hat upon his head his stockings foul d ungart red and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay d he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet s transformation so i call it since nor th exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father s death that thus hath put him so much from th understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbour d to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open d lies within our remedy good gentlemen he hath much talk d of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king s remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is heavens make our

be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in exit polonius he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your son s distemper i doubt it is no

fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown gives a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such

son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have whilst she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this

him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter show d me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she receiv d his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceiv d it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look d upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time i d fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it prov d otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise points to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i ll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will try it enter hamlet reading but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading away i do beseech you both away i ll board him presently o give me leave exeunt king queen and attendants how does my good lord hamlet well god a mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you re a fishmonger not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that s very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter i have my lord let her not walk i th sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t how say you by that aside still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i ll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside though this be madness yet there is a method in t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not over happy on fortune s cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what s the news none my lord but that the world s grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark s a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch d heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz and we ll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no to guildenstern what say you aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is t possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius well be with you gentlemen hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts happily he s the second time come to them for they say an

en to t like french falconers fly at anything we see we ll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first what speech my lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg d for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her

that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look where he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god s bodikin man better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we ll hear a play tomorrow exeunt polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago first ay my lord we ll ha t tomorrow night you could for a need study a

in s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had

ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i ll observe his looks i ll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power t assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i ll have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king exit act iii scene i a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we o er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseech d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin d good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behav d if t be th affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring

coming let s withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wish d to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor s wrong the proud man s contumely the pangs of dispriz d love the law s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember d good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly thank you well well well my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re deliver i pray you now receive them no not i i never gave you aught my honour d lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath compos d as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord ha ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where s your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool

expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i ll be plac d so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine

the word to the action with this special observance that you o erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is

make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably first i hope we have reform d that indifferently with us sir o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary

sledded polacks on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appear d to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride dar d to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem d him did slay this fortinbras who by a seal d compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seiz d of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had return d to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same cov nant and carriage of the article design d his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark d up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our

thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak the cock crows stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan do if it will not stand tis here tis here exit ghost tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt scene elsinore a room of state in the castle enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barr d your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltemand and cornelius and now laertes what s the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father s leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal d my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart

the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it

subject to his birth he may not as unvalu d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscrib d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster d importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her

i did intend it marry well said very well said look you sir enquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him do you mark this reynaldo ay very well my lord and in part him but you may say not well but if t be he i mean he s very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty as gaming my lord ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far my lord that would dishonour him faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that s not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault but my good lord wherefore should you do this ay my lord i would know that marry sir here s my drift and i believe it is a fetch of warrant you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soil d i th working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assur d he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country very good my lord and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes with you thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such and such and as you say there was he gaming there o ertook in s rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not my lord i have god b wi you fare you well good my lord observe his inclination in yourself i shall my lord and let him ply his music well my lord farewell exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now ophelia what s the matter alas my lord i have been so affrighted with what in the name of god my lord as i was sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac d no hat upon his head his stockings foul d ungart red and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay d he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet s transformation so i call it since nor th exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father s death that thus hath put him so much from th understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbour d to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open d lies within our remedy good gentlemen he hath much talk d of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king s remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is heavens make our

be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in exit polonius he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your son s distemper i doubt it is no other but the main his father s death and our o erhasty marriage well we shall sift him enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew s levies which to him appear d to be a preparation gainst the polack but better look d into he truly found it was against your highness whereat griev d that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown gives a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down it likes us well and at our more consider d time we ll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labour go to your rest at night we ll feast together most welcome home exeunt voltemand and cornelius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have whilst she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this

him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter show d me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she receiv d his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceiv d it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look d upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time i d fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it prov d otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise points to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i ll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will

conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t how say you by that aside still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i ll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside though this be madness yet there is a method in t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not over happy on fortune s cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what s the news none my lord but that the world s grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark s a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch d heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz and we ll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no to guildenstern what say you aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is t possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius well be with you gentlemen hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts happily he s the second time come to them for they say an

en to t like french falconers fly at anything we see we ll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first what speech my lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg d for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel and bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven as low as to the fiends this is too long it shall to the barber s with your beard prythee say on he s for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps

s state would treason have pronounc d but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband s limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look where he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god s bodikin man better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we ll hear a play tomorrow exeunt polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago first ay my lord we ll ha t tomorrow night you could for a need study a

guildenstern my good friends i ll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore good my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern ay so god b wi ye now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wan d tears in his eyes distraction in s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most dear life a damn d defeat was made am i a coward who calls me villain breaks my pate across plucks off my beard and blows it in my face tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i th throat as deep as to the lungs who does me this ha swounds i should take it for it cannot be but i am pigeon liver d and lack gall to make oppression bitter or ere this i should have fatted all the region kites with this

revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a scullion fie upon t foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim d their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i ll observe his looks i ll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power t assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i ll have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king exit act iii scene i a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we o er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseech d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin d good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behav d if t be th affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much prov d that with devotion s visage and pious action we do sugar o er the devil himself aside o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot s cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden i hear him coming let s withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wish d to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor s wrong the proud man s contumely the pangs of dispriz d love the law s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember d good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly thank you well well well my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re deliver i pray you now receive them no not i i never gave you aught my honour d lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath compos d as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord ha ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where s your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in s own house farewell o help him you sweet heavens if thou dost marry i ll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell o heavenly powers restore

that unmatch d form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy o woe is me t have seen what i have seen see what i see enter king and polonius love his affections do not that way tend nor what he spake though it lack d form a little was not like madness there s something in his soul o er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i ll be plac d so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatch d go exeunt scene a hall in the castle enter hamlet and certain players speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it first i warrant your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably first i hope we have reform d that indifferently with us sir o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that s villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready exeunt players enter polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern

breast in second husband let me be accurst none wed the second but who kill d the first aside wormwood wormwood player the instances that second marriage move are base respects of thrift but none of love a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed player i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break purpose is but the slave to memory of violent birth but poor validity which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending doth the purpose lose the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy where joy most revels grief doth most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident this world is not for aye nor tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change for tis a question left us yet to prove whether love lead fortune or else fortune love the great man down you mark his favourite flies the poor advanc d makes friends of enemies and hitherto doth love on fortune tend for who not needs shall never lack a friend and who in want a hollow friend doth try directly seasons him his enemy but orderly to end where i begun our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown our

sledded polacks on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appear d to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride dar d to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem d him did slay this fortinbras who by a seal d compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seiz d of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had return d to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same cov nant and carriage of the article design d his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark d up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to

thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak the cock crows stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan do if it will not stand tis here tis here exit ghost tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt scene elsinore a room of state in the castle enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barr d your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltemand and cornelius and now laertes what s the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father s leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal d my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool d for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforc d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king s rouse the heaven shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away exeunt all but hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fix d his canon gainst self slaughter o god o god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie on t oh fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father s body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn d longer married with mine uncle my father s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and barnardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend i ll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord i am very glad to see you good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg a truant disposition good my lord i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore we ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart my lord i came to see your father s funeral i prithee do not mock me fellow student i think it was to see my mother s wedding indeed my lord it follow d hard upon thrift thrift horatio the funeral bak d meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio my father methinks i see my father where my lord in my mind s eye horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for god s love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encounter d a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap a pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk d by their oppress d and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon s length whilst they distill d almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish d from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honour d lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight mar and we do my lord arm d say you both arm d my lord from top to toe my lord from head to foot then saw you not his face o yes my lord he wore his beaver up what look d he frowningly a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red nay very pale and fix d his eyes upon you most constantly i would i had been there it would have much amaz d you very like very like stay d it long while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred marcellus and longer longer not when i saw t his beard was grizzled no it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver d i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again i warrant you it will if it assume my noble father s person i ll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceal d this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare ye well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve i ll visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell exeunt horatio marcellus and barnardo my father s spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes exit scene a room in polonius s house enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries are embark d farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh d his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalu d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscrib d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster d importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclos d and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near i shall th effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whilst like a puff d and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay d for there my blessing with you laying his hand on laertes s head and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportion d thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatch d unfledg d comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear t that th opposed may beware of thee give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each man s censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express d in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station

house enter polonius and reynaldo give him this money and these notes reynaldo i will my lord you shall do marvellous wisely good reynaldo before you visit him to make inquiry of his behaviour my lord i did intend it marry well said very well said look you sir enquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him do you mark this reynaldo ay very well my lord and in part him but you may say not well but if t be he i mean he s very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty as gaming my lord ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far my lord that would dishonour him faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that s not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault but my good lord wherefore should you do this ay my lord i would know that marry sir here s my drift and i believe it is a fetch of warrant you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soil d i th working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assur d he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country very good my lord and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes with you thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such and such and as you say there was he gaming there o ertook in s rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not my lord i have god b wi you fare you well good my lord observe his inclination in yourself i shall my lord and let him ply his music well my lord farewell exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now ophelia what s the matter alas my lord i have been so affrighted with what in the name of god my lord as i was sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac d no hat upon his head his stockings foul d ungart red and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay d he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet s transformation so i call it since nor th exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father s death that thus hath put him so much from th understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbour d to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open d lies within our remedy good gentlemen he hath much talk d of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king s remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him ay amen exeunt rosencrantz guildenstern and some attendants enter polonius th ambassadors from norway my good lord are joyfully return d thou still hast been the father of good news have i my lord assure you my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath us d to do that i have found the very cause of hamlet s lunacy o speak of that that do i long to hear give first admittance to th ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in exit polonius he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your son s distemper i doubt it is no other but the main his father s death and our o erhasty marriage well we shall sift him enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew s levies which to him appear d to be a preparation gainst the polack but better look d into he truly found it was against your highness whereat griev d that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown gives a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down it likes us well and at our more consider d time we ll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labour go to your rest at night we ll feast together most welcome home exeunt voltemand and cornelius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have whilst she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise reads to the celestial and my soul s idol the most beautified ophelia that s an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear reads these in her excellent white bosom these c came this from hamlet to her good madam stay awhile i will be faithful reads doubt thou the stars are fire doubt that the sun doth move doubt truth to be a liar but never doubt i love o dear ophelia i am ill at these numbers i have not art to reckon my groans but that i love thee best o most best believe it adieu thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter show d me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she receiv d his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceiv d it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look d upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time i d fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it prov d otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise points to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i ll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will try it enter hamlet reading but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading away i do beseech you both away i ll board him presently o give me leave exeunt king queen and attendants how does my good lord hamlet well god a mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you re a fishmonger not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that s very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter i have my lord let her not walk i th sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t how say you by that aside still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i ll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside though this be madness yet there is a method in t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not over happy on fortune s cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what s the news none my lord but that the world s grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark s a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch d heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz and we ll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no to guildenstern what say you aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is t possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius well be with you gentlemen hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts happily he s the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir for a monday morning twas so indeed my lord i have news to tell you my lord i have news to tell you when roscius was an actor in rome the actors are come hither my lord buzz buzz upon my honour then came each actor on his ass the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history

once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter

black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg d for

that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look where he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god s bodikin man better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we ll hear a

i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wan d tears in his eyes distraction in s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most

revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a scullion fie upon t foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim d their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i ll observe his looks i ll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power t assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i ll have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king exit act iii scene i a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we o er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseech d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin d good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behav d if t be th affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring

exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much prov d that with devotion s visage and pious action we do sugar o er the devil himself aside o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot s cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden i hear him coming let s withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wish d to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor s wrong the proud man s contumely the pangs of dispriz d love the law s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember d good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly

ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where s your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool

spake though it lack d form a little was not like madness there s something in his soul o er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i ll be plac d so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine

pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it first i warrant your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably first i hope we have reform d that indifferently with us sir o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that s villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready exeunt players enter polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern

of violent birth but poor validity which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending doth the purpose lose the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy where joy most revels grief doth most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident this world is not for aye nor tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change for tis a question left us yet to prove whether love lead fortune or else fortune love the great man down you mark his favourite flies the poor advanc d makes friends of enemies and hitherto doth love on fortune tend for who not needs shall never lack a

you once did love me and so i do still by these pickers and stealers good my lord what is your cause of distemper you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your

sledded polacks on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appear d to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride dar d to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem d him did slay this fortinbras who by a seal d compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seiz d of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had return d to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same cov nant and carriage of the article design d his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark d up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen re enter ghost but soft behold lo where it comes again i ll cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak the cock crows stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan do if it will not stand tis here tis here exit ghost tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt scene elsinore a room of state in the castle enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barr d your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltemand and cornelius and now laertes what s the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father s leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal d my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool d for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforc d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king s rouse the heaven shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away exeunt all but hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fix d his canon gainst self slaughter o god o god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie on t oh fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father s body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn d longer married with mine uncle my father s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and barnardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend i ll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord i am very glad to see you good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg a truant disposition good my lord i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore we ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart my lord i came to see your father s funeral i prithee do not mock me fellow student i think it was to see my mother s wedding indeed my lord it follow d hard upon thrift thrift horatio the funeral bak d meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio my father methinks i see my father where my lord in my mind s eye horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for god s love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encounter d a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap a pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk d by their oppress d and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon s length whilst they distill d almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish d from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honour d lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight mar and we do my lord arm d say you both arm d my lord from top to toe my lord from head to foot then saw you not his face o yes my lord he wore his beaver up what look d he frowningly a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red nay very pale and fix d his eyes upon you most constantly i would i had been there it would have much amaz d you very like very like stay d it long while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred marcellus and longer longer not when i saw t his beard was grizzled no it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver d i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again i warrant you it will if it assume my noble father s person i ll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceal d this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare ye well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve i ll visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell exeunt horatio marcellus and barnardo my father s spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes exit scene a room in polonius s house enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries are embark d farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh d his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalu d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscrib d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster d importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclos d and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near i shall th effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whilst like a puff d and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay d for there my blessing with you laying his hand on laertes s head and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportion d thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatch d unfledg d comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear t that th opposed may beware of thee give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each man s censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express d in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee most humbly do i take my leave my lord the time invites you go your servants tend farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you tis in my memory lock d and you yourself shall keep the key of it farewell exit what is t ophelia he hath said to you so please you something touching the lord hamlet marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me affection pooh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them i do not know my lord what i should think marry i ll teach you think yourself a baby that you have ta en these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase roaming it thus you ll tender me a fool my lord he hath importun d me with love in honourable fashion ay fashion you may call it go to go to and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to t i charge you come your ways i shall obey my lord exeunt scene the platform enter hamlet horatio and marcellus the air bites shrewdly it is very cold it is a nipping and an eager air what hour now i think it lacks of twelve no it is struck indeed i heard it not it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within what does this mean my lord the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge is it a custom ay marry is t and to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honour d in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduc d and tax d of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though perform d at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by their o ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature s livery or fortune s star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of evil doth all the noble substance often doubt to his own scandal look my lord it comes enter ghost angels and ministers of grace defend us be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn d bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell be thy intents wicked or charitable thou com st in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee i ll call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canoniz d bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurn d hath op d his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisit st thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do ghost beckons hamlet it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it no by no means it will not speak then will i follow it do not my lord why what should be the fear i do not set my life at a pin s fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself it waves me forth again i ll follow it what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o er his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fadoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath it waves me still go on i ll follow thee you shall not go my lord hold off your hands be rul d you shall not go my fate cries out and makes each petty artery in this body as hardy as the nemean lion s nerve ghost beckons still am i call d unhand me gentlemen breaking free from them by heaven i ll make a ghost of him that lets me i say away go on i

heaven will direct it nay let s follow him exeunt scene v a more remote part of the castle enter ghost and hamlet whither wilt thou lead me speak i ll go no further mark me i will my hour is almost come when i to sulph rous and tormenting flames must render up myself alas poor ghost pity me not but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold speak i am bound to hear so art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear what i am thy father s spirit doom d for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confin d to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purg d away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood list list o list if thou didst ever thy dear father love o god revenge his foul and most unnatural murder murder murder most foul as in the best it is but this most foul strange and unnatural haste me to know t that i with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love may sweep to my revenge i find thee apt and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that rots itself in ease on lethe wharf wouldst thou not stir in this now hamlet hear tis given out that sleeping in my orchard a serpent stung me so the whole ear of denmark is by a forged process of my death rankly abus d but know thou noble youth the serpent that did sting thy father s life now wears his crown o my prophetic soul mine uncle ay that incestuous that adulterate beast with witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts o wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seduce won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming virtuous queen o hamlet what a falling off was there from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine but virtue as it never will be mov d though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven so lust though to a radiant angel link d will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage but soft methinks i scent the morning air brief let me be sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigour it doth posset and curd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter bark d about most lazar like with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body thus was i sleeping by a brother s hand of life

i did intend it marry well said very well said look you sir enquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him do you mark this reynaldo ay very well my lord and in part him but you may say not well but if t be he i mean he s very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty as gaming my lord ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far my lord that would dishonour him faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that s not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault but my good lord wherefore should you do this ay my lord i would know that marry sir here s my drift and i believe it is a fetch of warrant you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soil d i th working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assur d he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country very good my lord and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes with you thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such and such and as you say there was he gaming there o ertook in s rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not my lord i have god b wi you fare you well good my lord observe his inclination in yourself i shall my lord and let him ply his music well my lord farewell exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now ophelia what s the matter alas my lord i have been so affrighted with what in the name of god my lord as i was sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac d no hat upon his head his stockings foul d ungart red and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay d he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet s transformation so i call it since nor th exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father s death that thus hath put him so much from th understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbour d to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open d lies within our remedy good gentlemen he hath much talk d of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king s remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is heavens make our

be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in exit polonius he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your son s distemper i doubt it is no other but the main his father s death and our o erhasty marriage well we shall sift him enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew s levies which to him appear d to be a preparation gainst the polack but better look d into he truly found it was against your highness whereat griev d that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown gives a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down it likes us well and at our more consider d time we ll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labour go to your rest at night we ll feast together most welcome home exeunt voltemand and cornelius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day

son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have whilst she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this

him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter show d me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she receiv d his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceiv d it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look d upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time i d fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it prov d otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise points to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i ll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will try it enter hamlet reading but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading away i do beseech you both away i ll board him presently o give me leave exeunt king queen and attendants how does my good lord hamlet well god a mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you re a fishmonger not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that s very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter i have my lord let her not walk i th sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t how say you by that aside still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i ll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside though this be madness yet there is a method in t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not over happy on fortune s cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what s the news none my lord but that the world s grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark s a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch d heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz and we ll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no to guildenstern what say you aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is t possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius well be with you gentlemen hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts happily he s the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir for a monday morning twas so indeed my lord i have news to tell you my lord i have news to tell you when roscius was an actor in rome the actors are come hither my lord buzz buzz upon my honour then came each actor on his ass the best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history

aside still on my daughter am i not i th right old jephthah if you call me jephthah my lord i have a daughter that i love passing well nay that follows not what follows then my lord why as by lot god

en to t like french falconers fly at anything we see we ll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first what speech my lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg d for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her

s state would treason have pronounc d but if the gods themselves did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husband s limbs the instant burst of clamour that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look where he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god s bodikin man better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we ll hear a play tomorrow exeunt polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago first ay my lord we ll ha t tomorrow night you could for a need study a

in s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most

play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim d their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i ll observe his looks i ll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power t assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i ll have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king exit act iii scene i a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we o er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseech d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin d good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behav d if t be th affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an

consummation devoutly to be wish d to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give

weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember d good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly

ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where s your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool

to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i ll be plac d so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine

fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it first i warrant your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is

your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary

watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse and even the like precurse of fierce events as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climatures and countrymen re enter ghost but soft behold lo where it comes again i ll cross it though it blast me stay illusion if thou hast any sound or use of voice speak to me if there be any good thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak the cock crows stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan do if it will not stand tis here tis here exit ghost tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt scene elsinore a room of state in the castle enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barr d your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltemand and cornelius and now laertes what s the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father s leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal d my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool d for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforc d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king s rouse the heaven shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away exeunt all but hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew or that the everlasting had not fix d his canon gainst self slaughter o god o god how weary stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world fie on t oh fie tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed things rank and gross in nature possess it merely that it should come to this but two months dead nay not so much not two so excellent a king that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father s body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn d longer married with mine uncle my father s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is not nor it cannot come to good but break my heart for i must hold my tongue enter horatio marcellus and barnardo hail to your lordship i am glad to see you well horatio or i do forget myself the same my lord and your poor servant ever sir my good friend i ll change that name with you and what make you from wittenberg horatio marcellus my good lord i am very glad to see you good even sir but what in faith make you from wittenberg a truant disposition good my lord i would not hear your enemy say so nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself i know you are no truant but what is your affair in elsinore we ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart my lord i came to see your father s funeral i prithee do not mock me fellow student i think it was to see my mother s wedding indeed my lord it follow d hard upon thrift thrift horatio the funeral bak d meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables would i had met my dearest foe in heaven or ever i had seen that day horatio my father methinks i see my father where my lord in my mind s eye horatio i saw him once he was a goodly king he was a man take him for all in all i shall not look upon his like again my lord i think i saw him yesternight saw who my lord the king your father the king my father season your admiration for a while with an attent ear till i may deliver upon the witness of these gentlemen this marvel to you for god s love let me hear two nights together had these gentlemen marcellus and barnardo on their watch in the dead waste and middle of the night been thus encounter d a figure like your father armed at point exactly cap a pie appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them thrice he walk d by their oppress d and fear surprised eyes within his truncheon s length whilst they distill d almost to jelly with the act of fear stand dumb and speak not to him this to me in dreadful secrecy impart they did and i with them the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it would speak but even then the morning cock crew loud and at the sound it shrunk in haste away and vanish d from our sight tis very strange as i do live my honour d lord tis true and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me hold you the watch tonight mar and we do my lord arm d say you both arm d my lord from top to toe my lord from head to foot then saw you not his face o yes my lord he wore his beaver up what look d he frowningly a countenance more in sorrow than in anger pale or red nay very pale and fix d his eyes upon you most constantly i would i had been there it would have much amaz d you very like very like stay d it long while one with moderate haste might tell a hundred marcellus and longer longer not when i saw t his beard was grizzled no it was as i have seen it in his life a sable silver d i will watch tonight perchance twill walk again i warrant you it will if it assume my noble father s person i ll speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace i pray you all if you have hitherto conceal d this sight let it be tenable in your silence still and whatsoever else shall hap tonight give it an understanding but no tongue i will requite your loves so fare ye well upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve i ll visit you our duty to your honour your loves as mine to you farewell exeunt horatio marcellus and barnardo my father s spirit in arms all is not well i doubt some foul play would the night were come till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise though all the earth o erwhelm them to men s eyes exit scene a room in polonius s house enter laertes and ophelia my necessaries are embark d farewell and sister as the winds give benefit and convoy is assistant do not sleep but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh d his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalu d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscrib d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster d importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclos d and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent be wary then best safety lies in fear youth to itself rebels though none else near i shall th effect of this good lesson keep as watchman to my heart but good my brother do not as some ungracious pastors do show me the steep and thorny way to heaven whilst like a puff d and reckless libertine himself the primrose path of dalliance treads and recks not his own rede o fear me not i stay too long but here my father comes enter polonius a double blessing is a double grace occasion smiles upon a second leave yet here laertes aboard aboard for shame the wind sits in the shoulder of your sail and you are stay d for there my blessing with you laying his hand on laertes s head and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportion d thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar those friends thou hast and their adoption tried grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new hatch d unfledg d comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in bear t that th opposed may beware of thee give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each man s censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not express d in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel oft proclaims the man and they in france of the best rank and station are of a most select and generous chief in that neither a borrower nor a lender be for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man farewell my blessing season this in thee most humbly do i take my leave my lord the time invites you go your servants tend farewell ophelia and remember well what i have said to you tis in my memory lock d and you yourself shall keep the key of it farewell exit what is t ophelia he hath said to you so please you something touching the lord hamlet marry well bethought tis told me he hath very oft of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so tis put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behoves my daughter and your honour what is between you give me up the truth he hath my lord of late made many tenders of his affection to me affection pooh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them i do not know my lord what i should think marry i ll teach you think yourself a baby that you have ta en these tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase roaming it thus you ll tender me a fool my lord he hath importun d me with love in honourable fashion ay fashion you may call it go to go to and hath given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moment leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to t i charge you come your ways i shall obey my lord exeunt scene the platform enter hamlet horatio and marcellus the air bites shrewdly it is very cold it is a nipping and an eager air what hour now i think it lacks of twelve no it is struck indeed i heard it not it then draws near the season wherein the spirit held his wont to walk a flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within what does this mean my lord the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down the kettle drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge is it a custom ay marry is t and to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honour d in the breach than the observance this heavy headed revel east and west makes us traduc d and tax d of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though perform d at height the pith and marrow of our attribute so oft it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by their o ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature s livery or fortune s star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of evil doth all the noble substance often doubt to his own scandal look my lord it comes enter ghost

questionable shape that i will speak to thee i ll call thee hamlet king father royal dane o answer me let me not burst in ignorance but tell why thy canoniz d bones hearsed in death have burst their cerements why the sepulchre wherein we saw thee quietly inurn d hath op d his ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again what may this mean that thou dead corse again in complete steel revisit st thus the glimpses of the moon making night hideous and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls say why is this wherefore what should we do ghost beckons hamlet it beckons you to go away with it as if it some impartment did desire to you alone look with what courteous action it waves you to a more removed ground but do not go with it no by no means it will not speak then will i follow it do not my lord why what should be the fear i do not set my life at a pin s fee and for my soul what can it do to that being a thing immortal as itself it waves me forth again i ll follow it what if it tempt you toward the flood my lord or to the dreadful summit of the cliff that beetles o er his base into the sea and there assume some other horrible form which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness think of it the very place puts toys of desperation without more motive into every brain that looks so many fadoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath it waves me still go on i ll follow thee you shall not go my lord hold off your hands be rul d you shall not go my fate cries out and makes each petty

when thou shalt hear what i am thy father s spirit doom d for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confin d to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purg d away but that i am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house i could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood

wicked wit and gifts that have the power so to seduce won to his shameful lust the will of my most seeming virtuous queen o hamlet what a falling off was there from me whose love was of that dignity that it went hand in hand even with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor to those of mine but virtue as it never will be mov d though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven so lust though to a radiant angel link d will sate itself in a celestial bed and prey on garbage but soft methinks i scent the morning air brief let me be sleeping within my orchard my custom always of the afternoon upon my secure hour thy uncle stole with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial and in the porches of my ears did pour the leperous distilment whose effect holds such an enmity with blood of man that swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of the body and with a sudden vigour it doth posset and curd like eager droppings into milk the thin and wholesome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter bark d about most lazar like with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body thus was i sleeping by a brother s hand of life of crown of queen at once dispatch d cut off even in the blossoms of my sin unhous led disappointed unanel d no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head o horrible o

i did intend it marry well said very well said look you sir enquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him do you mark this reynaldo ay very well my lord and in part him but you may say not well but if t be he i mean he s very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty as gaming my lord ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far my lord that would dishonour him faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that s not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault but my good lord wherefore should you do this ay my lord i would know that marry sir here s my drift and i believe it is a fetch of warrant you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soil d i th working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assur d he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country very good my lord and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes with you thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such and such and as you say there was he gaming there o ertook in s rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not my lord i have god b wi you fare you well good my lord observe his inclination in yourself i shall my lord and let him ply his music well my lord farewell exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now ophelia what s the matter alas my lord i have been so affrighted with what in the name of god my lord as i was sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac d no hat upon his head his stockings foul d ungart red and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay d he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet s transformation so i call it since nor th exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father s death that thus hath put him so much from th understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbour d to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open d lies

true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have whilst she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this

him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter show d me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she receiv d his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceiv d it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look d upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time i d fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it prov d otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise points to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i ll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will

good lord hamlet well god a mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you re a fishmonger not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that s very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter i have my lord let her not walk i th sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t how say you by that aside still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i ll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside though this be madness yet there is a method in t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord my most dear lord my excellent good friends how dost thou guildenstern ah rosencrantz good lads how do ye both as the indifferent children of the earth happy in that we are not over happy on fortune s cap we are not the very button nor the soles of her shoe neither my lord then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours faith her privates we in the secret parts of fortune o most true she is a strumpet what s the news none my lord but that the world s grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark s a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch d heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz and we ll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no to guildenstern what say you aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is t possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius well be with you gentlemen hark you guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts happily he s the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players mark it you say right sir for a monday morning twas so indeed my lord i have news to tell you my lord i have news to tell

en to t like french falconers fly at anything we see we ll have a speech straight come give us a taste of your quality come a passionate speech first what speech my lord i heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg d for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her

that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look where he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god s bodikin man better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we ll hear a play tomorrow exeunt polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago first ay my lord we ll ha t tomorrow night you could for a need study a

guildenstern my good friends i ll leave you till night you are welcome to elsinore good my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern ay so god b wi ye now i am alone o what a rogue and peasant slave am i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wan d tears in his eyes distraction in s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most

revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a scullion fie upon t foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim d their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i ll observe his looks i ll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power t assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i ll have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king exit act iii scene i a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we o er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseech d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin d good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behav d if t be th affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much prov d that with devotion s visage and pious action we do sugar o er the devil himself aside o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot s cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden i hear him coming let s withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wish d to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor s wrong the proud man s contumely the pangs of dispriz d love the law s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember d good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly thank you well well well my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re deliver i pray you now receive them no not i i never gave you aught my honour d lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath compos d as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord ha ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where s your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in s own house farewell o help him you sweet heavens if thou dost marry i ll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get thee to a nunnery go farewell or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them to a nunnery go and quickly too farewell o heavenly powers restore

spake though it lack d form a little was not like madness there s something in his soul o er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i ll be plac d so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think it shall be so madness in great ones must not unwatch d go exeunt scene a hall in the castle enter hamlet and certain players speak the speech i pray you as i pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it first i warrant your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably first i hope we have reform d that indifferently with us sir o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that s villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready exeunt players enter polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern

sledded polacks on the ice tis strange thus twice before and jump at this dead hour with martial stalk hath he gone by our watch in what particular thought to work i know not but in the gross and scope of my opinion this bodes some strange eruption to our state good now sit down and tell me he that knows why this same strict and most observant watch so nightly toils the subject of the land and why such daily cast of brazen cannon and foreign mart for implements of war why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task does not divide the sunday from the week what might be toward that this sweaty haste doth make the night joint labourer with the day who is t that can inform me that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image even but now appear d to us was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride dar d to the combat in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our known world esteem d him did slay this fortinbras who by a seal d compact well ratified by law and heraldry did forfeit with his life all those his lands which he stood seiz d of to the conqueror against the which a moiety competent was gaged by our king which had return d to the inheritance of fortinbras had he been vanquisher as by the same cov nant and carriage of the article design d his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of unimproved mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway here and there shark d up a list of lawless resolutes for food and diet to some enterprise that hath a stomach in t which is no other as it doth well appear unto our state but to recover of us by strong hand and terms compulsatory those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the main motive of our preparations the source of this our watch and the chief head of this post haste and rummage in the land i think it be no other but e en so well may it sort that this portentous figure comes armed through our watch so like the king that was and is the question of these wars a mote it is to trouble the mind s eye in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets as stars with trains of fire and dews of blood disasters in the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptune s empire stands was sick almost to

thing to be done that may to thee do ease and grace to me speak to me if thou art privy to thy country s fate which happily foreknowing may avoid o speak or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life extorted treasure in the womb of earth for which they say you spirits oft walk in death speak of it stay and speak the cock crows stop it marcellus shall i strike at it with my partisan do if it will not stand tis here tis here exit ghost tis gone we do it wrong being so majestical to offer it the show of violence for it is as the air invulnerable and our vain blows malicious mockery it was about to speak when the cock crew and then it started like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the morn doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air th extravagant and erring spirit hies to his confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation it faded on the crowing of the cock some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviour s birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit dare stir abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallow d and so gracious is the time so have i heard and do in part believe it but look the morn in russet mantle clad walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill break we our watch up and by my advice let us impart what we have seen tonight unto young hamlet for upon my life this spirit dumb to us will speak to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needful in our loves fitting our duty let s do t i pray and i this morning know where we shall find him most conveniently exeunt scene elsinore a room of state in the castle enter claudius king of denmark gertrude the queen hamlet polonius laertes voltemand cornelius lords and attendant though yet of hamlet our dear brother s death the memory be green and that it us befitted to bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so far hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow think on him together with remembrance of ourselves therefore our sometime sister now our queen th imperial jointress to this warlike state have we as twere with a defeated joy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage in equal scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor have we herein barr d your better wisdoms which have freely gone with this affair along for all our thanks now follows that you know young fortinbras holding a weak supposal of our worth or thinking by our late dear brother s death our state to be disjoint and out of frame colleagued with this dream of his advantage he hath not fail d to pester us with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him now for ourself and for this time of meeting thus much the business is we have here writ to norway uncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bed rid scarcely hears of this his nephew s purpose to suppress his further gait herein in that the levies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subject and we here dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearers of this greeting to old norway giving to you no further personal power to business with the king more than the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your haste commend your duty cornelius and in that and all things will we show our duty we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exeunt voltemand and cornelius and now laertes what s the news with you you told us of some suit what is t laertes you cannot speak of reason to the dane and lose your voice what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more native to the heart the hand more instrumental to the mouth than is the throne of denmark to thy father what wouldst thou have laertes dread my lord your leave and favour to return to france from whence though willingly i came to denmark to show my duty in your coronation yet now i must confess that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend again toward france and bow them to your gracious leave and pardon have you your father s leave what says polonius he hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave by laboursome petition and at last upon his will i seal d my hard consent i do beseech you give him leave to go take thy fair hour laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cousin hamlet and my son aside a little more than kin and less than kind how is it that the clouds still hang on you not so my lord i am too much i the sun good hamlet cast thy nighted colour off and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know st tis common all that lives must die passing through nature to eternity ay madam it is common if it be why seems it so particular with thee seems madam nay it is i know not seems tis not alone my inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black nor windy suspiration of forc d breath no nor the fruitful river in the eye nor the dejected haviour of the visage together with all forms moods shows of grief that can denote me truly these indeed seem for they are actions that a man might play but i have that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suits of woe tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschool d for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie tis a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe and think of us as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you for your intent in going back to school in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remain here in the cheer and comfort of our eye our chiefest courtier cousin and our son let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i pray thee stay with us go not to wittenberg i shall in all my best obey you madam why tis a loving and a fair reply be as ourself in denmark madam come this gentle and unforc d accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no jocund health that denmark drinks today but the great cannon to the clouds shall tell and the king s rouse the heaven shall bruit again re speaking earthly thunder come away exeunt all but hamlet o that this too too solid flesh would

that was to this hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother that he might not beteem the winds of heaven visit her face too roughly heaven and earth must i remember why she would hang on him as if increase of appetite had grown by what it fed on and yet within a month let me not think on t frailty thy name is woman a little month or ere those shoes were old with which she followed my poor father s body like niobe all tears why she even she o god a beast that wants discourse of reason would have mourn d longer married with mine uncle my father s brother but no more like my father than i to hercules within a month ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes she married o most wicked speed to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets it is

the third night kept the watch where as they had deliver d both in time form of the thing each word made true and good the apparition comes i knew your father these hands are not more like but where was this my lord upon the platform where we watch did you not speak to it my lord i did but answer made it none yet once methought it lifted up it head and did address itself to motion like as it

sleep but let me hear from you do you doubt that for hamlet and the trifling of his favour hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no more but so think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear his greatness weigh d his will is not his own for he himself is subject to his birth he may not as unvalu d persons do carve for himself for on his choice depends the sanctity and health of this whole state and therefore must his choice be circumscrib d unto the voice and yielding of that body whereof he is the head then if he says he loves you it fits your wisdom so far to believe it as he in his particular act and place may give his saying deed which is no further than the main voice of denmark goes withal then weigh what loss your honour may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmaster d importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep you in the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her

extinct in both even in their promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be something scanter of your maiden presence set your entreatments at a higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether may he walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that dye which their investments show but mere implorators of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds the better to beguile this is for all i would not in plain terms from this time forth have

as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by their o ergrowth of some complexion oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much o erleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being nature s livery or fortune s star his virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man

house enter polonius and reynaldo give him this money and these notes reynaldo i will my lord you shall do marvellous wisely good reynaldo before you visit him to make inquiry of his behaviour my lord i did intend it marry well said very well said look you sir enquire me first what danskers are in paris and how and who what means and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more nearer than your particular demands will touch it take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him do you mark this reynaldo ay very well my lord and in part him but you may say not well but if t be he i mean he s very wild addicted so and so and there put on him what forgeries you please marry none so rank as may dishonour him take heed of that but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty as gaming my lord ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling drabbing you may go so far my lord that would dishonour him faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandal on him that he is open to incontinency that s not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind a savageness in unreclaimed blood of general assault but my good lord wherefore should you do this ay my lord i would know that marry sir here s my drift and i believe it is a fetch of warrant you laying these slight sullies on my son as twere a thing a little soil d i th working mark you your party in converse him you would sound having ever seen in the prenominate crimes the youth you breathe of guilty be assur d he closes with you in this consequence good sir or so or friend or gentleman according to the phrase or the addition of man and country very good my lord and then sir does he this he does what was i about to say by the mass i was about to say something where did i leave at closes in the consequence at friend or so and gentleman at closes in the consequence ay marry he closes with you thus i know the gentleman i saw him yesterday or t other day or then or then with such and such and as you say there was he gaming there o ertook in s rouse there falling out at tennis or perchance i saw him enter such a house of sale videlicet a brothel or so forth see you now your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth and thus do we of wisdom and of reach with windlasses and with assays of bias by indirections find directions out so by my former lecture and advice shall you my son you have me have you not my lord i have god b wi you fare you well good my lord observe his inclination in yourself i shall my lord and let him ply his music well my lord farewell exit reynaldo enter ophelia how now ophelia what s the matter alas my lord i have been so affrighted with what in the name of god my lord as i was sewing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all unbrac d no hat upon his head his stockings foul d ungart red and down gyved to his ankle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors he comes before me mad for thy love my lord i do not know but truly i do fear it what said he he took me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arm and with his other hand thus o er his brow he falls to such perusal of my face as he would draw it long stay d he so at last a little shaking of mine arm and thrice his head thus waving up and down he rais d a sigh so piteous and profound as it did seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being that done he lets me go and with his head over his shoulder turn d he seem d to find his way without his eyes for out o doors he went without their help and to the last bended their light on me come go with me i will go seek the king this is the very ecstasy of love whose violent property fordoes itself and leads the will to desperate undertakings as oft as any passion under heaven that does afflict our natures i am sorry what have you given him any hard words of late no my good lord but as you did command i did repel his letters and denied his access to me that hath made him mad i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him i fear d he did but trifle and meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion come go we to the king this must be known which being kept close might move more grief to hide than hate to utter love exeunt scene a room in the castle enter king queen rosencrantz guildenstern and attendants welcome dear rosencrantz and guildenstern moreover that we much did long to see you the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending something have you heard of hamlet s transformation so i call it since nor th exterior nor the inward man resembles that it was what it should be more than his father s death that thus hath put him so much from th understanding of himself i cannot dream of i entreat you both that being of so young days brought up with him and since so neighbour d to his youth and humour that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open d lies within our remedy good gentlemen he hath much talk d of you and sure i am two men there are not living to whom he more adheres if it will please you to show us so much gentry and good will as to expend your time with us awhile for the supply and profit of our hope your visitation shall receive such thanks as fits a king s remembrance both your majesties might by the sovereign power you have of us put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty we both obey and here give up ourselves in the full bent to lay our service freely at your feet to be commanded thanks rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern thanks guildenstern and gentle rosencrantz and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changed son go some of you and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him ay amen exeunt rosencrantz guildenstern and some attendants enter polonius th ambassadors from norway my good lord are joyfully return d thou still hast been the father of good news have i my lord assure you my good liege i hold my duty as i hold my soul both to my god and to my gracious king and i do think or else this brain of mine hunts not the trail of policy so sure as it hath us d to do that i have found the very cause of hamlet s lunacy o speak of that that do i long to hear give first admittance to th ambassadors my news shall be the fruit to that great feast thyself do grace to them and bring them in exit polonius he tells me my sweet queen that he hath found the head and source of all your son s distemper i doubt it is no other but the main his father s death and our o erhasty marriage well we shall sift him enter polonius with voltemand and cornelius welcome my good friends say voltemand what from our brother norway most fair return of greetings and desires upon our first he sent out to suppress his nephew s levies which to him appear d to be a preparation gainst the polack but better look d into he truly found it was against your highness whereat griev d that so his sickness age and impotence was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests on fortinbras which he in brief obeys receives rebuke from norway and in fine makes vow before his uncle never more to give th assay of arms against your majesty whereon old norway overcome with joy gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee and his commission to employ those soldiers so levied as before against the polack with an entreaty herein further shown gives a paper that it might please you to give quiet pass through your dominions for this enterprise on such regards of safety and allowance as therein are set down it likes us well and at our more consider d time we ll read answer and think upon this business meantime we thank you for your well took labour go to your rest at night we ll feast together most welcome home exeunt voltemand and cornelius this business is well ended my liege and madam to expostulate what majesty should be what duty is why day is day night night and time is time were nothing but to waste night day and time therefore since brevity is the soul of wit and tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes i will be brief your noble son is mad mad call i it for to define true madness what is t but to be nothing else but mad but let that go more matter with less art madam i swear i use no art at all that he is mad tis true tis true tis pity and pity tis tis true a foolish figure but farewell it for i will use no art mad let us grant him then and now remains that we find out the cause of this effect or rather say the cause of this defect for this effect defective comes by cause thus it remains and the remainder thus perpend i have a daughter have whilst she is mine who in her duty and obedience mark hath given me this now gather and surmise reads to the celestial and my soul s idol the most beautified ophelia that s an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear reads these in her

him hamlet this in obedience hath my daughter show d me and more above hath his solicitings as they fell out by time by means and place all given to mine ear but how hath she receiv d his love what do you think of me as of a man faithful and honourable i would fain prove so but what might you think when i had seen this hot love on the wing as i perceiv d it i must tell you that before my daughter told me what might you or my dear majesty your queen here think if i had play d the desk or table book or given my heart a winking mute and dumb or look d upon this love with idle sight what might you think no i went round to work and my young mistress thus i did bespeak lord hamlet is a prince out of thy star this must not be and then i precepts gave her that she should lock herself from his resort admit no messengers receive no tokens which done she took the fruits of my advice and he repulsed a short tale to make fell into a sadness then into a fast thence to a watch thence into a weakness thence to a lightness and by this declension into the madness wherein now he raves and all we wail for do you think tis this it may be very likely hath there been such a time i d fain know that that i have positively said tis so when it prov d otherwise not that i know take this from this if this be otherwise points to his head and shoulder if circumstances lead me i will find where truth is hid though it were hid indeed within the centre how may we try it further you know sometimes he walks four hours together here in the lobby so he does indeed at such a time i ll loose my daughter to him be you and i behind an arras then mark the encounter if he love her not and be not from his reason fall n thereon let me be no assistant for a state but keep a farm and carters we will try it enter hamlet reading but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading away i do beseech you both away i ll board him presently o give me leave exeunt king queen and attendants how does my good lord hamlet well god a mercy do you know me my lord excellent well you re a fishmonger not i my lord then i would you were so honest a man honest my lord ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand that s very true my lord for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion have you a daughter i have my lord let her not walk i th sun conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive friend look to t how say you by that aside still harping on my daughter yet he knew me not at first he said i was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love very near this i ll speak to him again what do you read my lord words words words what is the matter my lord between who i mean the matter that you read my lord slanders sir for the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plum tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams all which sir though i most powerfully and potently believe yet i hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir should be old as i am if like a crab you could go backward aside though this be madness yet there is a method in t will you walk out of the air my lord into my grave indeed that is out o the air aside how pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of i will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter my honourable lord i will most humbly take my leave of you you cannot sir take from me anything that i will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life fare you well my lord these tedious old fools enter rosencrantz and guildenstern you go to seek the lord hamlet there he is to polonius god save you sir exit polonius my honoured lord

she is a strumpet what s the news none my lord but that the world s grown honest then is doomsday near but your news is not true let me question more in particular what have you my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune that she sends you to prison hither prison my lord denmark s a prison then is the world one a goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons denmark being one o th worst we think not so my lord why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me it is a prison why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream a dream itself is but a shadow truly and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow s shadow then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretch d heroes the beggars shadows shall we to th court for by my fay i cannot reason rosencrantz and we ll wait upon you no such matter i will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man i am most dreadfully attended but in the beaten way of friendship what make you at elsinore to visit you my lord no other occasion beggar that i am i am even poor in thanks but i thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny were you not sent for is it your own inclining is it a free visitation come deal justly with me come come nay speak what should we say my lord why anything but to the purpose you were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour i know the good king and queen have sent for you to what end my lord that you must teach me but let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our ever preserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no to guildenstern what say you aside nay then i have an eye of you if you love me hold not off my lord we were sent for i will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave o erhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so my lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts why did you laugh then when i said man delights not me to think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you we coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service he that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt for t what players are they even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of the city how chances it they travel their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways i think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation do they hold the same estimation they did when i was in the city are they so followed no indeed they are not how comes it do they grow rusty nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for t these are now the fashion and so berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither what are they children who maintains em how are they escoted will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like if their means are no better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy there was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question is t possible o there has been much throwing about of brains do the boys carry it away ay that they do my lord hercules and his load too it is not very strange for my uncle is king of denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out flourish of trumpets within there are the players gentlemen you are welcome to elsinore your hands come the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which i tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours you are welcome but my uncle father and aunt mother are deceived in what my dear lord i am but mad north north west when the wind is southerly i know a hawk from a handsaw enter polonius well be

once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play i remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general but it was as i received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning i remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine one speech in it i chiefly loved twas aeneas tale to dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of priam s slaughter if it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see the rugged pyrrhus like th hyrcanian beast it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable arms black as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and black complexion smear d with heraldry more dismal head to foot now is he total gules horridly trick d with blood of fathers mothers daughters sons bak d and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and a damned light to their vile murders roasted in wrath and fire and thus o ersized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus old grandsire priam seeks so proceed you fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion first anon he finds him striking too short at greeks his antique sword rebellious to his arm lies where it falls repugnant to command unequal match d pyrrhus at priam drives in rage strikes wide but with the whiff and wind of his fell sword th unnerved father falls then senseless ilium seeming to feel this blow with flaming top stoops to his base and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus ear for lo his sword which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam seem d i th air to stick so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a neutral to his will and matter did nothing but as we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death anon the dreadful thunder doth rend the region so after pyrrhus pause aroused vengeance sets him new a work and never did the cyclops hammers fall on mars s armour forg d for proof eterne with less remorse than pyrrhus bleeding sword now falls on priam out out thou strumpet fortune all you gods in general synod take away her power break all the spokes and fellies from her

that she made unless things mortal move them not at all would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven and passion in the gods look where he has not turn d his colour and has tears in s eyes pray you no more tis well i ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon good my lord will you see the players well bestowed do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live my lord i will use them according to their desert god s bodikin man better use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping use them after your own honour and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty take them in come sirs follow him friends we ll hear a play tomorrow exeunt polonius with all the players but the first dost thou hear me old friend can you play the murder of gonzago first ay my lord we ll ha t tomorrow night you could for a need study a

i is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wan d tears in his eyes distraction in s aspect a broken voice and his whole function suiting with forms to his conceit and all for nothing for hecuba what s hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for her what would he do had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech make mad the guilty and appal the free confound the ignorant and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears yet i a dull and muddy mettled rascal peak like john a dreams unpregnant of my cause and can say nothing no not for a king upon whose property and most

revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore unpack my heart with words and fall a cursing like a very drab a scullion fie upon t foh about my brain i have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim d their malefactions for murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ i ll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle i ll observe his looks i ll tent him to the quick if he but blench i know my course the spirit that i have seen may be the devil and the devil hath power t assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits abuses me to damn me i ll have grounds more relative than this the play s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king exit act iii scene i a room in the castle enter king queen polonius ophelia rosencrantz and guildenstern and can you by no drift of circumstance get from him why he puts on this confusion grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy he does confess he feels himself distracted but from what cause he will by no means speak nor do we find him forward to be sounded but with a crafty madness keeps aloof when we would bring him on to some confession of his true state did he receive you well most like a gentleman but with much forcing of his disposition niggard of question but of our demands most free in his reply did you assay him to any pastime madam it so fell out that certain players we o er raught on the way of these we told him and there did seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it they are about the court and as i think they have already order this night to play before him tis most true and he beseech d me to entreat your majesties to hear and see the matter with all my heart and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin d good gentlemen give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights we shall my lord exeunt rosencrantz and guildenstern sweet gertrude leave us too for we have closely sent for hamlet hither that he as twere by accident may here affront ophelia her father and myself lawful espials will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen we may of their encounter frankly judge and gather by him as he is behav d if t be th affliction of his love or no that thus he suffers for i shall obey you and for your part ophelia i do wish that your good beauties be the happy cause of hamlet s wildness so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again to both your honours madam i wish it may exit queen ophelia walk you here gracious so please you we will bestow ourselves to ophelia read on this book that show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness we are oft to blame in this tis too much prov d that with devotion s visage and pious action we do sugar o er the devil himself aside o tis too true how smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience the harlot s cheek beautied with plastering art is not more ugly to the thing that helps it than is my deed to my most painted word o heavy burden i hear him coming let s withdraw my lord exeunt king and polonius enter hamlet to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them to die to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to tis a consummation devoutly to be wish d to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dream ay there s the rub for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause there s the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would bear the whips and scorns of time the oppressor s wrong the proud man s contumely the pangs of dispriz d love the law s delay the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin who would these fardels bear to grunt and sweat under a weary life but that the dread of something after death the undiscover d country from whose bourn no traveller returns puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of thus conscience does make cowards of us all and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and enterprises of great pith and moment with this regard their currents turn awry and lose the name of action soft you now the fair ophelia nymph in thy orisons be all my sins remember d good my lord how does your honour for this many a day i humbly thank you well well well my lord i have remembrances of yours that i have longed long to re deliver i pray you now receive them no not i i never gave you aught my honour d lord you know right well you did and with them words of so sweet breath compos d as made the things more rich their perfume lost take these again for to the noble mind rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind there my lord ha ha are you honest my lord are you fair what means your lordship that if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof i did love you once indeed my lord you made me believe so you should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it i loved you not i was the more deceived get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners i am myself indifferent honest but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me i am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than i have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in what should such fellows as i do crawling between earth and heaven we are arrant knaves all believe none of us go thy ways to a nunnery where s your father at home my lord let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but in s own house farewell o help him you sweet heavens if thou dost marry i ll give thee this plague for thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny get

spake though it lack d form a little was not like madness there s something in his soul o er which his melancholy sits on brood and i do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger which for to prevent i have in quick determination thus set it down he shall with speed to england for the demand of our neglected tribute haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something settled matter in his heart whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself what think you on t it shall do well but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love how now ophelia you need not tell us what lord hamlet said we heard it all my lord do as you please but if you hold it fit after the play let his queen mother all alone entreat him to show his grief let her be round with him and i ll be plac d so please you in the ear of all their conference if she find him not to england send him or confine

pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it as many of your players do i had as lief the town crier spoke my lines nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as i may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness o it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise i would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing termagant it out herods herod pray you avoid it first i warrant your honour be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you o erstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance o erweigh a whole theatre of others o there be players that i have seen play and heard others praise and that highly not to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of christians nor the gait of christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature s journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably first i hope we have reform d that indifferently with us sir o reform it altogether and let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered that s villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it go make you ready exeunt players enter polonius rosencrantz and guildenstern

love a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed player i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine oft we break purpose is but the slave to memory of violent birth but poor validity which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be most necessary tis that we forget to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending doth the purpose lose the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy where joy most revels grief doth most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident this world is not for aye nor tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change for tis a question left us yet to prove whether love lead fortune or else fortune love the great man down you mark his favourite flies the poor advanc d makes friends of enemies and hitherto doth love on fortune tend for who not needs shall never lack a friend and who in want a hollow friend doth try directly seasons him his enemy but orderly to end where i begun our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown our

you once did love me and so i do still by these pickers and stealers good my lord what is your cause of distemper you do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your

wringing of your hands peace sit you down and let me wring your heart for so i shall if it be made of penetrable stuff if damned custom have not braz d it so that it is proof and bulwark against sense what have i done that thou dar st wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and sets a blister there makes marriage vows as false as dicers oaths o such a deed as from the body of contraction plucks the very soul and sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words heaven s face doth glow yea this solidity and compound mass with tristful visage as against the doom is thought sick at the act ay me what act that roars so loud and thunders in the index look here upon this picture and on this the counterfeit presentment of two brothers see what a grace was seated on this brow hyperion s curls the front of jove himself an eye like mars to threaten and command a station like the herald mercury new lighted on a heaven kissing hill a combination and a form indeed where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance of a man this was your husband look you now what follows here is your husband like a mildew d ear blasting his wholesome brother have you eyes could you on this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on this moor ha have you eyes you cannot call it love for at your age the hey day in the blood is tame it s humble and waits upon the judgment and what judgment would step from this to this sense sure you have else could you not have motion but sure that sense is apoplex d for madness would not err nor sense to ecstacy was ne er so thrall d but it reserv d some quantity of choice to serve in such a difference what devil was t that thus hath cozen d you at hoodman blind eyes without feeling feeling without sight ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all or but a sickly part of one true sense could not so mope o shame where is thy blush rebellious hell if thou canst mutine in a matron s bones to flaming youth let virtue be as wax and melt in her own fire proclaim no shame when the compulsive ardour gives the charge since frost itself as actively doth burn and reason panders will o hamlet speak no more thou turn st mine eyes into my very soul and there i see such black and grained spots as will not leave their tinct nay but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed stew d in corruption honeying and making love over the nasty sty o speak to me no more these words like daggers enter in mine ears no more sweet hamlet a murderer and a villain a slave that is not twentieth part the tithe of your precedent lord a vice of kings a cutpurse of the empire and the rule that from a shelf the precious diadem stole and put it in his pocket no more a king of shreds and patches enter ghost save me and hover o er me with your wings you heavenly guards what would your gracious figure alas he s mad do you not

look amazement on thy mother sits o step between her and her fighting soul conceit in weakest bodies strongest works speak to her hamlet how is it with you lady alas how is t with you that you do bend your eye on vacancy and with the incorporal air do hold discourse forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep and as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm your bedded hairs like life in excrements start up and stand an end o gentle son upon the heat and flame of thy distemper sprinkle cool patience whereon do you look on him on him look you how pale he glares his form and cause conjoin d preaching to stones would make them capable do not look upon me lest with this piteous action you convert my stern effects then what i have to do will want true colour tears perchance for blood to whom do you
